**Write a discussion (4-5 Lines) explaining the comparison between two models. Moreover, compare the metrics and discuss which metrics are more appropriate compared to human evaluation.**
Mistral and Phi-2 edgeds out Llama in most metrics.  Phi-2 performed especially well. Llama lost points  because it often added answers to instructions it was not given.  It had a hard time knowing when the answer was complete.  This might have been because of the limited training I had to do.
